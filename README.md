This is a copy of [Stellar](https://html5up.net/stellar) by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net). I've re-factored the code to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) so that it can be hosted with Github Pages. This also allows for auto-compilation of the [Sass](http://sass-lang.cpm) to CSS. The design is also responsive, powered by [Skel](http://skel.io), and has a sticky nav bar powered by [Scrollex](https://github.com/ajlkn/jquery.scrollex).

You can see a demo [here](http://mrhornsby.github.io/html5up-stellar).
